# Java Programming III Course Projects
This repository showcases projects completed througout the duration of the CS300 Java Programming III course at the University of Wisconsin-Madison in Spring 2024. These software projects were designed and utilized object-oriented and functional programming to write both backend and frontend code, implementing balanced search trees, graphs, hash tables, and complexity analysis, incorporating industry-standard development practices, version control, and advanced user-interface design.

Please see the repositories below for each completed project iteration. Each project implements an isolated aspect of the overarching project, a full-stack interactive song database and filtering system.

## Full-Stack Interactive Song Database
[iSongify](https://github.com/sierrareschke/cs400_transfer/tree/main/A1.SGRESCHKE.CUDZINOVIC2):
Co-developed a full-stack app that filters songs by implementing interfaces, classes, data structures (binary search and red-black trees), recursive algorithms, Comparables, command-line interface, JUnit testing, anonymous classes, and OOP principles.
